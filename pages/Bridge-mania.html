                <h2>Problem Statement</h2><br>
                <ul>
                <p><li>Design a Bridge using Popsicle sticks (ice-cream sticks) satisfying the stated constraints</li></p><br>
                <h4>Conditions:</h4><br>
                  <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Open to B.E. / B. Tech and Polytechnic level students only. Unleash your academic knowledge and put it to the test in a fun and practical way!</li><br>
                  <li><strong>Material:</strong> Channel your inner MacGyver! You'll be provided with the essential tools: Popsicle sticks, adhesive, and a cutter. Bridge dimensions will be revealed at the competition, so bring your strategic thinking A-game. (Don't forget your own scale, pencil, eraser, and pen - they'll be your trusty allies!)</li><br>
                  <li><strong>Team Power:</strong> Teamwork makes the dream work! Collaborate with up to 3 fellow engineers to brainstorm, design, and build the ultimate popsicle stick bridge. Remember, communication and teamwork are key!</li><br>
                  <li><strong>Time Crunch:</strong> Think fast and build smart! You'll have 4 hours to transform those humble popsicle sticks into a masterpiece of structural integrity and architectural wonder. Time management will be your secret weapon!</li><br>
                <p>So, are you ready to rise to the challenge? Grab your team, unleash your creativity, and prepare to build the strongest, most innovative bridge using only popsicle sticks! Impress the judges with your engineering prowess and win bragging rights (and maybe even some awesome prizes!).</p><br>
